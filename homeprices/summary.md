# Home Purchase vs. Rent Analysis Summary

## Parameter Choices Analysis

The model uses several key parameters that significantly impact the analysis:

- **Home Price**: $1,320,600 (Berkeley median) - This reflects current market conditions but varies significantly by neighborhood
- **Mortgage Rate**: 6.50% (30-year fixed) - Currently realistic given market conditions
- **Appreciation Rate**: 5.60% - Based on Berkeley historical average, though past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- **Investment Return**: 5.00% - Conservative estimate for a moderate-risk portfolio
- **Maintenance Cost**: 1.50% of home value - Reasonable for older Berkeley homes
- **Property Tax**: 0.79% - Accurate per California's Prop 13
- **Transaction Costs**: 3% buying, 6% selling - Standard for the market

The parameters appear well-researched and reasonable, though some (like appreciation rate) could be stress-tested with more conservative values.

## Analysis of Options

### Buying Option (NPV: $-688,346)
- Requires significant upfront costs ($264,120 down payment + $39,618 closing costs)
- High annual costs ($110,374) including:
  - Mortgage: $80,132
  - Maintenance: $19,809
  - Property Tax: $10,433
- After 6 years:
  - Home appreciates to $1,831,280
  - But remaining mortgage ($1,541,000) and selling costs ($54,938) eat into equity
  - Net sale proceeds $235,342

### Renting Option (NPV: $-170,008)
- Annual costs starting at $31,200
- 3% annual rent increases
- More flexibility
- No maintenance responsibilities
- No exposure to housing market risks
- No transaction costs

### Renting + Stock Investment (NPV: $-141,989)
- Best financial outcome of the three options
- Invests difference between buying and renting costs
- Initial investment: $303,738 (down payment + closing costs)
- Annual investment: $79,174 (cost difference vs buying)
- Grows to $983,121 after 6 years
- Provides better liquidity than home equity

## Key Findings

1. Renting + investing the difference shows the best financial outcome, with an NPV $546,357 better than buying
2. High transaction costs significantly impact the buying scenario
3. Current high mortgage rates (6.50%) make buying less attractive
4. Even with 5.60% home appreciation, buying underperforms due to high costs
5. The shorter time horizon (6 years) works against buying due to transaction costs

## Recommendations

1. Consider renting and investing the difference in a diversified portfolio
2. If buying is preferred for non-financial reasons:
   - Plan for longer occupancy to spread out transaction costs
   - Consider waiting for lower mortgage rates
   - Look for properties with lower maintenance costs
3. Run sensitivity analysis on key assumptions:
   - Home appreciation rate
   - Investment returns
   - Holding period
